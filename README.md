# Vigenère cipher + e-mail integration

A project that uses the Vigenère cipher to encrypt a message and e-mail integration to send the encrypted text to a designated email. The e-mail part is under development/study for implementation.

This is a simple project where I expect to learn new things and build a functional service. Feel free to use/modify the code. :)
